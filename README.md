# CollatzConjecture
What is the Collatz conjecture?

In short, its a mathematical conjecture that can be defined as "Any positive interger (or whole number) will always return to 1 when processed using the following rules

If the interger is even, then divide by 2
If the interger is odd, then multiply by 3 and add 1
In all known cases, this will eventually return to 1 and enter the 4-2-1 loop. The 4-2-1 loop is a loop at the end of the calculations where 4 divided by 2 is 2, 2 divided by 2 is 1, and 1 mulitplied by 3 add 1 is 4, and so it enters a loop.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) covers the topic in far more detail.
