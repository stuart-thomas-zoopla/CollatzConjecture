<p>What is the Collatz conjecture?</p>
<p>In short, its a mathematical conjecture that can be defined as "Any positive interger (or whole number) will always return to 1 when processed using the following rules</p>
<ul><li>If the interger is <i>even</i>, then divide by 2</li>
<li>If the interger is <i>odd</i>, then multiply by 3 and add 1</li>
</ul>
<p>In all known cases, this will eventually return to 1 and enter the 4-2-1 loop.  The 4-2-1 loop is a loop at the end of the calculations where 4 divided by 2 is 2, 2 divided by 2 is 1, and 1 mulitplied by 3 add 1 is 4, and so it enters a loop.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Wikipedia</a> covers the topic in far more detail.</p>
<p>In the background of this website, running on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">raspberryPi</a>, is a simple console application that is continuously running numbers through the Collatz Conjecture</p>

<p>In the unlikely event the application succesfully identifies any numbers that do not conform to the Collatz Conjecture, they will appear below:</p>
